# const_static_inline_msvc_2019_ice

The following project is a example project that generates and ICE (internal compiler error) when compiling in Visual Studio 2019 (update 16.2). 

The code compiles, links and runs using GCC (gcc --version: `gcc (Ubuntu 8.3.0-6ubuntu1) 8.3.0`). In Visual Studio 2017 it gives a linker error, which IMO, is better than an ICE.
